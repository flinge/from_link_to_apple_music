# Convert playlist from any streaming service (Spotify, etc.) to Apple Music

## Step 1. Create a text file with links to songs in _your original_ service.
In case of Spotify it can be done by selecting all songs in playlist in _the desktop app_ and copying/pasting them to a plain text file. Save the file with a meaningful name (it will become your Apple Music playlist name) to iCloud, Dropbox, or whatever you use to sync files between desktop and iOS.

## Step 2. Get the shortcut.
Install [From link to apple music]() shortcut.

## Step 3. Run the shortcut.
Run the shortcut. It will ask you for the file. Point it to the file you've saved.
